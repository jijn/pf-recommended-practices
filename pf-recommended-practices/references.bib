We extend the classical first-order analysis of Young and Daly in the presence of a fault prediction system, characterized by its recall and its precision. In this framework, we provide optimal algorithms to decide whether and when to take predictions into account, and we derive the optimal value of the checkpointing period. These results allow us to analytically assess the key parameters that impact the performance of fault predictors at very large scale.}

We provide some backgroundand survey various scenarios to assess the usefulness and limitations of the formula, both for preemptible applications and workflow applications represented as a graph of tasks. We also discuss scenarios with uncertainties, and extend the study to silent errors. We exhibit cases where the optimal period is of a different order than that dictated by the Young/Daly formula, and finally we explain how checkpointing can be further combined with replication.}

    abstract = {This article revisits checkpointing strategies when workflows composed of multiple tasks execute on a parallel platform. The objective is to minimize the expectation of the total execution time. For a single task, the Young/Daly formula provides the optimal checkpointing period. However, when many tasks execute simultaneously, the risk that one of them is severely delayed increases with the number of tasks. To mitigate this risk, a possibility is to checkpoint each task more often than with the Young/Daly strategy. But is it worth slowing each task down with extra checkpoints? Does the extra checkpointing make a difference globally? This article answers these questions. On the theoretical side, we prove several negative results for keeping the Young/Daly period when many tasks execute concurrently, and we design novel checkpointing strategies that guarantee an efficient execution with high probability. On the practical side, we report comprehensive experiments that demonstrate the need to go beyond the Young/Daly period and to checkpoint more often for a wide range of application/platform settings.},

We explore this model in detail for a regular solution and show that four existing models can be recovered as special cases.

Using a phase-field variable and a corresponding governing equation to describe the state (solid or liquid) in a material as a function of position and time, the diffusion equations for heat and solute can be solved without tracking the liquid-solid interface. The interfacial regions between liquid and solid involve smooth but highly localized variations of the phase-field variable. The method has been applied to a wide variety of problems including dendritic growth in pure materials; dendritic, eutectic, and peritectic growth in alloys; and solute trapping during rapid solidification.},

This book treats irreversible processes and phenomena — non-equilibrium thermodynamics. S. R. de Groot and P.

The application covers a wide range of topics: the theory of diffusion and heat conduction, fluid dynamics, relaxation phenomena, acoustical relaxation, and the behavior of systems in an electromagnetic field.The statistical foundations of non-equilibrium thermodynamics are treated in detail, and there are special sections on fluctuation theory, the theory of stochastic processes, the kinetic theory of gases, and the derivation of the Onsager reciprocal relations. The implications of causality conditions and of dispersion relations are analyzed in depth.Advanced students will find a great number of challenging problems, with hints for their solutions. Chemists will be especially interested in the applications to electrochemistry and the theory of chemical reactions. Physicists, teachers, scholars, biologists, and anyone interested in the principle and modern applications of non-equilibrium thermodynamics will find this classic monograph an invaluable reference.},

In addition to its role in research integrity, improving the reproducibility of scientific studies can accelerate evaluation and reuse. This potential and wide support for the FAIR principles have motivated interest in metadata standards supporting reproducibility. Metadata provide context and provenance to raw data and methods and are essential to both discovery and validation. Despite this shared connection with scientific data, few studies have explicitly described how metadata enable reproducible computational research. This review employs a functional content analysis to identify metadata standards that support reproducibility across an analytic stack consisting of input data, tools, notebooks, pipelines, and publications. Our review provides background context, explores gaps, and discovers component trends of embeddedness and methodology weight from which we derive recommendations for futurework.}

The material undergoing the creep deformation is treated as a nonhydrostatically stressed multicomponent solid medium with nonconserved lattice sites and inhomogeneities handled by employing gradient thermodynamics. Phase fields describe microstructure evolution, which gives rise to redistribution of vacancy sinks and sources in the material during the creep process. We derive a general expression for the entropy production rate and use it to identify of the relevant fluxes and driving forces and to formulate phenomenological relations among them taking into account symmetry properties of the material. As a simple application, we analyze a one-dimensional model of a bicrystal in which the grain boundary acts as a sink and source of vacancies. The kinetic equations of the model describe a creep deformation process accompanied by grain boundary migration and relative rigid translations of the grains. They also demonstrate the effect of grain boundary migration induced by a vacancy concentration gradient across the boundary.},
